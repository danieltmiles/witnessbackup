<h1>Privacy Policy for [Your App Name]</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 6, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>WitnessBackup ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how our video recording app handles your information.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
<p><strong>Camera Permission:</strong> Our app requests access to your device's camera solely to enable video recording functionality. We do not collect, store, transmit, or have any access to the videos you record.</p>

<p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Videos are stored on your device until you choose to delete them. Optionally, if you configure a cloud storage connection, videos will be uploaded to your chosen storage provider.</p>

<p><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not operate servers that store, process, or have access to your videos or personal information.</p>

<h2>3. Cloud Storage Integration</h2>
<p>Our app automatically uploads videos directly to cloud storage services you configure, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Drive</li>
    <li>Dropbox</li>
    <li>WebDAV-compatible services</li>
</ul>
If you do not configure any cloud storage service, the app will not upload anything to anywhere.

<div class="important">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Your videos are sent directly from your device to your chosen storage provider. We never have access to your videos or your cloud storage credentials. Your privacy relationship is with your storage provider, and their privacy policies govern how they handle your data:
    <ul>
        <li>Google Drive Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
        <li>Dropbox Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>Videos remain on your local device until you choose to delete them. Any cloud storage credentials stored by the app are encrypted and stored locally on your device.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our app integrates with third-party cloud storage services. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these services.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data, you maintain complete control over your videos through your chosen cloud storage provider.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
